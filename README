					Ontology Recommender - Aug 14, 2014
					===================================

What is it?
-----------

The Ontology Recommender is a software designed to find the best ontologies 
for a specific ontology annotation problem. Given an input text or a set of 
keywords, the Recommender evaluates all the ontologies in the BioPortal 
repository according to several predefined evaluation criteria and provides 
a ranked list of ontologies (or sets of ontologies) to annotate the input. 
The Recommender has been developed as a JSON web service so that it can be 
invoked programmatically by remote clients.


Version
-------

This version of the Ontology Recommender is being developed by Marcos
Martinez-Romero <marcosmartinez@udc.es> at the Stanford Center for Biomedical 
Informatics Research. It is being designed to replace the current Ontology 
Recommender, available at BioPortal (http://bioportal.bioontology.org/recommender).


Main files and packages
-----------------------

- /src/Test.java -> Testing class that allows to execute the Recommender for
a given input. The output will be printed on the Console.

- /src/edu/stanford/bmir/ncbo/recommender/Recommender2Facade.java -> This class
provides an interface to the getRanking(...) method, which is the main functionality
provided by the Recommender. For a given input, it provides a list of ontologies
(or ontology sets) to annotate that input.

- /src/edu/stanford/bmir/ncbo/recommender/ -> It contains all the classes that
implement the recommendation functionality. The "service" subfolder contains the
code used to implement the Recommender web service using the DropWizard framework. 

- /src/edu/stanford/bmir/ncbo/annotator/ -> This folder contains classes to
obtain all the annotations for a given input using the BioPortal API, as well
as some classes to achieve basic operations with annotations.

- /src/edu/stanford/bmir/ncbo/ontologies/ ->  Classes to represent BioPortal 
ontologies and to operate with them.

- /src/edu/stanford/bmir/ncbo/ontologyevaluator/ -> This folder contains classes
to evaluate ontologies according to three different evaluation criteria: acceptance 
of the ontology by the biomedical community, level of coverage provided by the
ontology and specialization of the ontology for the input provided.

- /config/ -> System configuration file (config.properties), which contains the API 
Key used to access to the BioPortal API as well as other configuration settings.

- /data/ -> Data files using during the ontology evaluation process.
